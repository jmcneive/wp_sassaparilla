Empty Shell
===========

### An empty WordPress theme development, combined with Sassaparilla abilities for styling.

Super simple starting point for wp-theme making, combining the always useful [Migration Theme](https://github.com/sirjonathan/migration-theme) from [Jonathan Wold](https://github.com/sirjonathan) and the powerful [Sassaparilla](https://github.com/fffunction/sassaparilla?source=c) by [fffunctions](fffunction.co).
It's an empty shell to start off WP theme development.

Sassaparilla grasps the power of Sass, that I tend to compile on server, seeing the wordpress changes happening live.

Once you've got your [Compass up and running](http://ndever.net/articles/linux/installing-sass-and-compass-ubuntu-1210-1304) head to your /wp-content/themes/ folder and place this directory there. 

Head to /themes/empty-shell/ and run Compass to watch that folder.
